Git is a version control system (vcs)
git inti - intiate or reinitiate git repo or directory
git add - will track untracked file // branch 2
git branch - will create new branch
this line is only present in second branch
git merge will merge two branches.
git rebase - will add the branch to the head branch without any commit. But in merge there will be a commit.
            and main purpose of rebase is to keep commits and branches in clean manner.
